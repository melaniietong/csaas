# Contribution guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

- We’re a **community-driven, volunteer-maintained** project.
- We’re fully **asynchronous** — no mandatory meetings, no rigid roadmaps. Contribute when and where you can!

## GitHub workflow

We use GitHub to manage all aspects of the project.

All communication happens on GitHub. This may feel unfamiliar if you’re non-technical, but it’s standard practice for open-source collaboration.

If you’re new to GitHub issues, we recommend starting with the official documentation:
https://docs.github.com/en/issues

## Contributing

1. Start by [creating an issue](https://github.com/canadian-software/web/issues/new/)

Whether you’re reporting a bug or proposing a feature, open an issue first. This helps prevent duplicated or wasted work.

2. Align on scope

Maintainers and community members will use the issue thread to clarify the problem and agree on the approach.

3. Claim the task

If you’d like to work on it, comment on the issue:

- State your interest
- Provide an estimated completion date
- You’ll then be assigned to the issue.

For technical contributors: open a PR linked to the issue. You might also find it help to read our [architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md) and [setup](./SETUP.md) guide.

Non-technical contributors: use the issue itself to track and share your work.

## Maintainers

Maintainers are project stewards. They oversee the codebase and review incoming contributions.

Current maintainers:

- [melaniietong](https://github.com/melaniietong/)

Maintainers are committed to reviewing submissions and moving the project forward in a timely manner. However, tasks may go through multiple review cycles to ensure quality and accuracy.

At this time, we are not looking to add additional maintainers.

## Communication expectations

Because we operate asynchronously, **communication is critical**.

When writing issues or comments:

- Provide enough context for others to understand the full picture
- Include screenshots, sources, or references when possible

If you take on a task:

- Follow through on your stated timeline
- Share progress updates proactively
- Communicate blockers early

Contributors have lives outside the project, we understand. If you need more time, just let us know! We’re happy to accommodate when expectations are clear.

## Still unsure how to get started?

If you’re feeling stuck or unsure where to begin, don’t hesitate to reach out to a maintainer. We’re happy to help guide you and answer any questions!
